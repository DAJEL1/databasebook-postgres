# About this book

This book is intended as a first introduction to relational databases or for those who have a little experience to review the fundamentals of data modeling and SQL.  It may be suitable as a textbook for a university course.  In particular, it may be a good supplement for one of those overpriced, theory-heavy textbooks that universities like to assign.  Due to its low price and its focus on practical data modeling patterns, students may use this book for additional practice and self-study.

Also, as far as I know, it's the only such textbook to use PostgreSQL as the database of choice for examples.  PostgreSQL or "Postgres" is an increasingly popular, free and open source database that runs on all the major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), making it a great choice for the classroom or independent learner.
